		<h2 style="color:red">Russia</h2>
		<p>I have traveled to Soviet Russia where I learned to fully dismantle and reassemble an AK-47, load, and fire with high accuracy. I stayed in a military barracks with some Russian friends and cracked open some ice cold vodka with the boys.</p>
		<h2 style="color:yellow">Italy</h2>
		<p>I have traveled around Italy and took a commercial flight to an island called Sardegna. On this island I went snorkeling in the mediterranean and played water polo with Germans, Italians, and French people.</p>
		<h2 style="color:green">Hawaii</h2>
		<p>I have traveled to Hawaii and climbed on lava rock parks, visited famous beaches, and stayed at a local Hawaiian family's home.</p>
